❌ **Sorry, this project is private!
<br> 

📌 Overview
This is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) built using Python and powered by Google Generative AI for resume parsing and analysis. It extracts data from resumes in PDF or Image format and provides insights using AI.<br/> 

🚀 Features<br/>
✅ Resume Parsing – Extracts text from PDF and image-based resumes.<br/> 
✅ AI-Powered Analysis – Uses Google Generative AI to analyze resumes.<br/>
✅ Streamlit UI – Simple and interactive web-based interface. <br/>
✅ Environment Variable Support – Uses .env for API keys and configurations.<br/>

<br/>
🛠️ Tech Stack<br/>
Python <br/>
Streamlit (for the UI)<br/>
Google Generative AI (for resume analysis)<br/>
pdf2image (for PDF to image conversion)<br/>
PIL (Pillow) (for image processing)<br/>
dotenv (for managing environment variables)<br/>
Base64 (for encoding/decoding)<br/>

📂 Installation & Setup<br/>
1️⃣ Clone the Repository<br/>
2️⃣ Create and Activate a Virtual Environment<br/>
3️⃣ Install Dependencies : pip install -r requirements.txt  <br/>
4️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables Create a .env file and add: GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key  <br/>
5️⃣ Run the Application <br/>

<br/>
🎯 How It Works<br/>
Upload a resume (PDF or Image format).<br/>
The system extracts text using pdf2image and PIL.<br/>
Google Generative AI analyzes the resume content.<br/>
Insights and recommendations are displayed in the Streamlit UI.<br/>

<br/>
